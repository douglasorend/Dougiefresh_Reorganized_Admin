[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod makes a variety of changes to the Admin area in order to more logically order the mods installed into the Admin area.  Most were dumped into the [b]Configuration[/b] area by the mod authors, which was fine, but it creates a big mess that I really got tired off.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Compatibility Notes[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.9, but should work on earlier versions of SMF 2.0.x.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Other Notes[/u][/size][/b][/color]
The reorganization of the Admin menu takes place AFTER the processing of the hooks....

[url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=3907]SMF 2.1-style Admin Area[/url] should be installed prior to this mod.

This mod was part of the [url=http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=520847.0]Real Tabs for Admin & Moderator Menus[/url] mod (version 2.x line) and has been expanded upon.

This mod does not install any other mods in order to use, so if the specified mod is not installed, no menu change will be made.
